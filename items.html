        This is not an official data source. I collected that knowledge by playing during Apogea's Playtest, by watching streams and by browsing Discord - various items come from different stages of the Playtest or probably even the previous ones. A lot of it is going to be changed. Moreover - it wasn't an automated process, I've rewritten all that from scratch. Expect errors and missing items. <span class="orange">The table is sortable.</span>
