Welcome! This website is dedicated to the game Apogea, a really cool MMORPG. The game is currently in development, time-limited playtests happen from time to time, and the game is expected to be released in 2025.
</p>
<p>
Currently, <span class="red">there is no playtest happening</span>, but you can check <a href="https://discord.gg/8vz7Q6J">the official Discord</a> for more information. The astrologists are predicting the <span class="red">next playtest might be opened some time between April and June</span>, so stay tuned.
</p>

<p>
    There are <span class="info">no quest spoilers</span> on this site, and there won't be any. There are lists of items, spells, calculators, and other references that may prove useful when deciding on a build or choosing which path to take.
