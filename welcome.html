Welcome! This website is dedicated to the game Apogea, a really cool MMORPG. The game is currently in development, time-limited playtests happen from time to time, and the game is expected to be released in 2025.
</p>
<p>
Currently, <span class="red">there is no playtest happening</span>, but you can check <a href="https://discord.gg/8vz7Q6J">the official Discord</a> for more information. The astrologists are predicting the <span class="red">next playtest to be opened between April and June</span>, so stay tuned!
</p>

    There are <u>no quest spoilers</u> on this site, and there won't be any. There are lists of items, calculators, and other references that you might find useful when deciding your build or path. Quests are fun, and well within everyone's reach to figure them out by themselves.<br> Go ahead, play the game - you don't need a babysitter, do you now? :)
